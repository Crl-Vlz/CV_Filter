# CV_Filter
School project to filter CVs using machine learning

---

Train a model that evaluates potential
employees using their CVs and the job they are
requesting.

Using natural language processing we will
extract the main skills and abilities out of the
CVs and compare them to the skills needed for
the job.

The model will offer feedback on whether the
applicant is a good match for the job.
